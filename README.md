## üìä Data Colletion
The V1 version of the paper collection was compiled by the end of 2023. The collection process was done via [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/), using an abstract search with the keyword "neural network," with the years set from 01/2014 to 01/2024. The collection was filtered for astronomy and limited to refereed publications.

**Search Query:**
```bash
abs:"neural network"

```
The query consists of 1,240 papers sourced from various journals. The pie chart below illustrates the distribution of these papers across the different journals.

### Stage I: 2014-2016 ‚Äî üå± Initial Application of Shallow Neural Networks
From 2014 to 2016, the neural networks introduced in astronomy were mostly shallow networks, typically with fewer than three layers and only a few dozen neurons. During this stage, neural networks did not have an advantage over traditional machine learning methods, such as support vector machines (SVM) and random forests.

### Stage II: 2017-2018 ‚Äî üß± Adoption of Basic CNNs and Conv1D
From 2017 to 2018, basic Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were introduced and widely applied to image processing tasks. Conv1D was also used for handling time series data during this period. The complexity and parameter size of the networks increased significantly, and their performance began to rival traditional machine learning methods.

### Stage III: 2019-2020 ‚Äî üöÄ Explosion of Deep Learning Applications
By 2019, the application of deep learning in astronomy entered a period of explosive growth. The key feature of this stage was the increasing use of deep learning to tackle tasks that traditional machine learning struggled with, such as complex image classification, object detection, and time series forecasting. During this period, we observed that CNN and NN architectures became more complex, with deeper networks and more layers, especially in handling large-scale astronomical datasets, where deep learning demonstrated significant potential. Models like **RNN** and **LSTM** also began to be applied for sequence data processing. Additionally, researchers started exploring explainable neural networks, such as **Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs)**, providing astronomers with models capable of uncertainty estimation.  Furthermore, generative models like **VAE**, **GAN**, and **Flow** were introduced for tasks such as data generation and reconstruction. The significant increase in publications in 2019 and 2020 marked the widespread adoption of deep learning technologies in astronomy.

### Stage IV: 2021-2023 ‚Äî üîß Advancement of Model Applications and Growth of Advanced Models
Starting in 2021, the growth rate of publications began to slow, as researchers increasingly relied on well-established models such as CNNs and NNs, achieving successful results across a wide range of astronomical tasks. Researchers also began leveraging the strengths of different models by combining multiple architectures to customize their networks for solving specific astronomical problems. However, as deep learning continued to evolve, more advanced models were gradually introduced. **Attention mechanisms (Transformers)** started being applied in astronomy, while generative models saw further development, with **VAE**, **Flow**, and **GAN** being increasingly utilized. **Diffusion models** were also introduced during this stage, showing great potential in generating astronomical images and data augmentation. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** also began to be explored for handling structured astronomical data. Additionally, **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** started to be used to model physical phenomena, allowing researchers to integrate physical laws into deep learning models.

### Stage V: 2024 and Beyond ‚Äî üåê Exploration of LLMs and Multimodal Models
Starting in 2024, it is noteworthy that deep learning in astronomy will further develop towards **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and multimodal foundational models. LLMs can create new applications, such as integrating expert knowledge to help researchers build intelligent agents, improving the efficiency of handling complex tasks. Meanwhile, multimodal foundational models can process various types of data, such as images, spectra, and time series, enhancing the model's generalization ability and solving more general tasks.
